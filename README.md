# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview 
   The challenge this week was for us to evaluate ride-sharing data by city type for a company called PyBer in order to glean insights into how to utilize the different attributes of certain city types to inform their decision making for both price formulation and recruitment efforts, among other business decisions.

## Results
   The data frame tells us that the most rides and the most drivers on the road both occur in Urban cities, followed by Suburban, and tailed by Rural communities.
   However, for the individual driver to consider, the average fare per ride and the average fare per driver both scale inversely to rides and driver count.
   The vast majority of the revenue share the company brings in, however, still comes from Urban environments--despite the fact that their contractors make less money per ride in these environments.
   Additionally, based on the multiple line chart, the trends per city type seem to maintain a relatively flat and consistent through-line. 

## Summary
   Increasing the number of drivers in Rural cities may yield an overall economy of scale to customer base usage. This could drive up the total revenue generated in these city types at the cost of making each individual journey earn the driver less money on average. Thus, recruitment and help wanted ad efforts in Rural cities might be able to bump up that revenue driver.
   You may want to increase your price per distance in Urban cities. The fact that so many of your passengers and rides come from this type of environment means that even a small bump on individual ride cost to the customer will yield a large surge in revenue for the company across all those many rides.
   You may also want to decrease the number of drivers employed in Urban environments. Several statistics in the Summary DataFrame point to the fact supply might be on the high side in this category. The average fare per ride in Urban cities is higher than the average fare per driver and there are more drivers than total rides in these cities. Some of your employees are inactive, underemployed, or waiting around. This may not be the best usage of resources.
